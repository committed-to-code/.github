## How to Get Help ðŸ™‹

### 1. Check the Documentation ðŸ“š
Before reaching out, please check our project's documentation (if available). Many common questions and issues are covered there.

### 2. Open an Issue on GitHub ðŸ’¬
For general questions, bug reports, or feature requests, the best place to get help is by **opening an issue on our GitHub repository**. This allows our community and maintainers to see your question and provide assistance. When opening an issue, please:

* **Describe your problem clearly and concisely.**
* **Include steps to reproduce** if you're reporting a bug.
* **Provide any relevant error messages or screenshots.**
* **Mention your environment** (e.g., operating system, project version).

### 3. Direct Email for Sensitive Matters ðŸ“§
If you have a question that involves **sensitive information** (e.g., private data, security concerns that can't be discussed publicly), please do **NOT** open a public issue. Instead, send an email directly to:

**committed-to-code@zue.dev**

We'll do our best to respond to sensitive inquiries as quickly as possible.
