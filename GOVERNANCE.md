## üèõÔ∏è Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the project. It describes the roles within the project, how decisions are made, and how new contributors can get involved in project leadership.

### Project Roles

Our project operates with the following key roles:

* **Contributors:** Anyone who submits code, documentation, bug reports, or feature requests. All contributions are valued and help shape the project.
* **Maintainers:** Individuals who are responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. Their responsibilities include:
    * Reviewing and merging pull requests.
    * Triaging issues and providing guidance.
    * Ensuring the project's health, quality, and adherence to its vision.
    * Making final decisions on technical direction.
* **Core Team:** A small group of highly active and trusted Maintainers who have demonstrated long-term commitment to the project. They are responsible for:
    * Setting the overall vision and strategic direction of the project.
    * Managing major releases.
    * Resolving disputes and making high-level policy decisions.
    * Onboarding new Maintainers.

### Decision-Making Process

We strive for a collaborative and transparent decision-making process:

* **Consensus-Based for Most Decisions:** For most technical and non-critical decisions (e.g., small bug fixes, minor feature enhancements), we aim for a consensus among the relevant Maintainers. Discussions typically happen on GitHub issues or pull requests.
* **Maintainer Discretion:** Maintainers have the autonomy to make decisions on issues within their area of responsibility, especially for routine tasks or clear-cut matters. If a decision has broader implications, it should be escalated.
* **Core Team for Major Decisions:** Significant changes, new features that impact the project's architecture, or disputes that cannot be resolved by Maintainers will be escalated to the Core Team. The Core Team makes decisions through discussion and, if necessary, a majority vote.
* **Transparency:** All decisions, especially those made by the Core Team, will be documented on GitHub issues, pull requests, or in dedicated meeting notes if applicable.

### Becoming a Maintainer or Core Team Member

We welcome new contributors to step into leadership roles based on their sustained contributions and commitment to the project:

* **Becoming a Maintainer:** Contributors who consistently provide high-quality code, helpful reviews, active participation in discussions, and demonstrate a good understanding of the project's codebase and vision may be invited to become Maintainers by the existing Core Team.
* **Becoming a Core Team Member:** Maintainers who demonstrate exceptional leadership, long-term dedication, strategic insight, and a proven ability to guide the project will be considered for elevation to the Core Team by existing Core Team members.

This governance model is subject to evolution as the project grows and adapts. We encourage open discussion and feedback on this document.
