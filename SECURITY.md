## Reporting a Vulnerability üîí

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities you find.

### Public Discussion
For most security-related matters that do not involve sensitive information, please **open a new issue** on our GitHub repository. This allows for open discussion and collaboration with the community to address the concern.

### Sensitive Information
If you discover a security vulnerability that involves **sensitive information** (e.g., potential data breaches, credentials exposure), please do **NOT** open a public issue. Instead, send an email directly to:

**committed-to-code@zue.dev**

When reporting a vulnerability via email, please include:

* A **detailed description** of the vulnerability.
* **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability.
* The **impact** of the vulnerability.
* Any **mitigation steps** you've already taken or recommend.
* Your **contact information** (optional, but helpful for follow-up).

## Our Commitment ü§ù

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and transparently. Upon receiving a report, we will:

1.  **Acknowledge** receipt of your report within 48 hours.
2.  **Investigate** the vulnerability thoroughly.
3.  **Keep you informed** of our progress.
4.  **Remediate** the vulnerability as quickly as possible.
5.  If applicable, **publicly disclose** the vulnerability and its resolution once it's safe to do so, crediting the discoverer if they wish.
